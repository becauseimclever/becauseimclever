            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hey there! I'm <strong>Darren Swan</strong>, though you'll usually find me going by <strong>Fortinbra</strong> online and in most settings. 
                I'm a passionate .NET Developer with nearly 20 years of experience writing code and building software solutions that actually work. 
                I'm happily married with no kids—just a house full of pets that keep life interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in backend development using C# and .NET, and I genuinely enjoy working with Blazor for modern web applications. 
                When I'm not writing code for work, I'm probably 3D printing enclosures for my IoT projects or building custom game controllers with GP2040-CE.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I've been in the software industry for almost two decades, helping businesses transform their requirements into robust technical solutions.
                My journey has taken me from building small desktop applications to architecting large-scale cloud-native systems. 
                Along the way, I've developed a deep appreciation for clean code, test-driven development, and systems that are built to last.

            <h1>About BecauseImClever</h1>
            <p>
                Right now, BecauseImClever is my digital playground—a place where I publish open-source projects, experiments, and professional work. 
                It's where I get to tinker with new technologies, build things that interest me, and share what I learn along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the long-term vision is bigger. <strong>BecauseImClever will eventually become a 501(c)(3) charitable organization</strong>, 
                with a special focus on providing custom gaming equipment to those who need it. Accessible gaming matters, and I want to help make it a reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                That future is still a ways off, but every project here is a step in that direction. In the meantime, thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet.

            <h1>Open Source Contributions</h1>
            <h2>GP2040-CE</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a contributor to <a href="https://gp2040-ce.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GP2040-CE</a>, an open-source firmware for RP2040-based game controllers. 
                It's a fantastic project that provides low-latency input for fight sticks, arcade controllers, and custom gaming peripherals.
            </p>
            <p>
                My contributions focus primarily on the build infrastructure—maintaining and improving the <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> workflows and <strong>CMake</strong> build files. 
                It's rewarding work that ensures the project builds reliably across different configurations and makes it easier for other contributors to get involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.

            <h1>My Pets 🐾</h1>
            <p>
                Outside of tech, my world revolves around my pets. I have <strong>4 dogs</strong> and <strong>4 chickens</strong>, and they mean everything to me. 
                The dogs keep me company during long coding sessions, and the chickens... well, they provide fresh eggs and endless entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's something grounding about stepping away from the screen to spend time with animals. They don't care about build failures or merge conflicts—they just want treats and attention.
