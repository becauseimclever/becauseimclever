# Blazor vs React

As a .NET developer, the choice between Blazor and React often comes down to ecosystem and language preference.

## Blazor

*   **Language**: C#
*   **Ecosystem**: .NET (NuGet)
*   **Interop**: JavaScript Interop available but minimized.

## React

*   **Language**: JavaScript / TypeScript
*   **Ecosystem**: npm / Node.js
*   **Community**: Massive, with libraries for everything.

## Conclusion

If you love C# and want to share code between client and server, Blazor is a fantastic choice. If you need the absolute widest range of UI libraries, React might still have the edge.
