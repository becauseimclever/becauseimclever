# Burnt Out

## Let's talk about Burnout
I've been burnt out more than a few times in my career. Big deadlines, multi-billion dollar deals, or just taking care of things around the house. It sucks, and it takes it's toll on my mental and physical health. I do not enjoy being almost bedridden with depression, being agitated at every little thing, or not being able to think realistically about what's going on. Being burnt out makes it harder to do everyday tasks, even ones you enjoy. 

## What is Burnout?
Let's take a second to define burnout. According to the Cambridge Dictionary:

> **burnout** (noun): extreme tiredness or mental or physical illness caused by working too hard.
>
> — [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/burnout)

And Merriam-Webster defines it as:

> **burnout** (noun): exhaustion of physical or emotional strength or motivation usually as a result of prolonged stress or frustration.
>
> — [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/burnout)

## How I know I'm burnt out
I don't always know I've reached the point of burnout until I'm there. But some red flags I've identified for myself through self reflection are increased irritibility, increased black and white thinking, and an increase in rigid beliefs and views. There's also a decrease in overall motivation, including things that I would normally enjoy. And finally, the depression is a major red flag. Being burnt out just sucks all the joy out of life.

## What caused it?
Burnout for me is usually caused by a lot of little things adding together into a big thing. The stress of household finances and chores, combined with the stress of work, but not just in general terms, but all the little things that you can typically just let go of, start to add up. You start to accumulate things that are harder and harder to let go of.

## What am I doing about it?
For starters, what I'm doing to help address it is by setting boundaries. For instance, at work everyday from noon to 1pm, I have my calendar blocked off as Out of Office, so that I have time to take care of personal things, eat lunch, and mentally prepare for the afternoon ahead. I also have side projects, like this blog, that I do because I enjoy doing it, and I make sure to make time for these activities. I keep my alerts from work to minimum outside of regular business hours. I am flexible about that, but I do try my best to keep work during work hours. It's important to keep a good Life-Work balance.
